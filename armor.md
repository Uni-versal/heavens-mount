## Upgrading
Monster Hunter games offer the ability to upgrade your armor, usually at the cost of money and Armor Spheres. Upgrades only raise the Defense value of the armor piece, and unless you're still using your starting armor or are at a point in the game where it's hard to acquire more Spheres, it's basically always worth doing.

## Resistances
Resists are rarely an important consideration while selecting armor parts, but it is worth understanding how they function. Armor pieces add resistance modifiers, which reduce or increase the elemental damage you receive of the appropriate type. The resistance is applied directly, as a percentage: if your Water resistance is -10, then you will receive 10% more damage from water attacks. A common damage type that monsters deal is Fire.

## Skill Points
Besides improving your defense, the primary motivation for using armor are Armor Skills, which are often badly misunderstood by beginners. Most armor pieces will grant you points in a skill; however, by itself, those points *do not do anything*. In order to receive the benefits of a Skill, you need to activate it by having 10(usually) or more points in that Skill. It is also possible to activate negative versions of some Skills with -10 points.
Some skills activate with merely 5 skill points, and some skills have better versions that can be activated at higher tresholds of 15 and 20 points. You can find this information by checking the skill database of the appropriate game online. You can find out your currently active armor skills and their point levels by checking your character's status pages.
It is quite important to use Armor Skills to do well in Monster Hunter. While the best builds vary wildly between games and weapons, and covering every situation is far beyond the scope of this guide, in many cases a good starting point is to simply try and get skills that directly help your damage, such as Attack Up. As you advance further in the game, ask other players, or do your research to find out what skills you should be using.

# Talismans and Decorations
Talismans and Decorations are special parts of your equipment that don't improve your defenses, but contribute to your Armor Skill Points. They're a very important part of activating Armor Skills, as just combining the right armor is often not enough.

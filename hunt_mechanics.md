This section will explain the combat mechanics of Monster Hunter. While you're free to ignore the inner workings of some, there are advantages you can gain by understanding them.

## Monster States
When the hunt starts, the monster is usually in its normal state. This will change as an effect of taking damage, as there are a few special states it can go in.
# Exhaust
Just as the hunter, monsters have stamina value that is hidden. Doing their attacks, or getting hit with Impact damage in parts that aren't the head, will reduce this value. When the monster reaches a low enough value, it'll go into a special, temporary Exhausted state. Exhaustion has many negative effects on the monster: they'll idle more while drooling, its attacks and movement become ineffective and sluggish, it loses the ability to Enrage, and effects of some items, such as traps, become more powerful on them. An exhausted monster will slowly regenerate stamina, it'll attempt to eat smaller monsters, as well as it'll use a biting attack more often. If it manages to bite a hunter twice, or finishes eating, it will instantly recover enough stamina to go back into its normal state.
There are a few other nuances to the way monster stamina works, as explained [here by GaijinHunter].
# Limp
A monster that took enough damage will eventually hit the limp threshold, which varies by monster and can be around 8%-16%. This will make their walk slower, and they'll start running away to other zones a lot more often. This is the cue for knowing that the monster's health is low, and that it can be captured, although the actual health threshold for capture is often a bit higher than limping, which means that monsters that aren't limping can be captured if their health is low enough. Many limping monsters, after they run away, will try to reach their nest and sleep, if they aren't interrupted.
# Sleep
Induced by low health or Sleep status damage, a sleeping monster will wake up after exactly one hit. This first hit will deal massive x3 damage, and every hit afterwards will be unmodified. This means that in order to make the most of this mechanic, it's important to wake up monsters with powerful, single hits, such as a charged Great Sword smash. A common technique is to set a single Large Bomb up next to the sleeping monsters, and hit it while taking care not to hit the monster, for example with a ranged weapon, a thrown stone, or a carefully positioned much smaller bomb. Wake-up bombs deal damage that is devastating to the monster's health and parts.
# Enrage
Some monsters possess the ability to enrage, which generally happens after taking a certain amount of damage. Enrage can be seen as the opposite of exhaust, and its effects vary quite a lot by monster; An enraged monster becomes far more aggressive and dangerous, with faster, more damaging attacks, sometimes accompanied by a drastic visual change in the monster's appearance, or signaled by a roar. They won't become exhausted until after the enrage ends, and items may have different effects on them. Even an enraged monster's defensive qualities will change, as their hit zones and elemental weaknesses shift. The enrage will end after the monster takes enough damage in some cases, while in others the hunters can wait it out.

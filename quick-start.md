** Quick-start
Aka, 'what should I know if I just want to jump in and play'?  
1. Hit it until it dies.
2. Keep your eyes on the monster.
3. Use the weapon(link to weapon stuff below) that you enjoy the most. They're all fully viable.
4. Sharpen your weapon, Blademasters. Shoot the head, Gunners.
5. Carry potions, and mega-potions if you can craft them.
6. Don't drink anywhere near the monster.
7. You can't roll through monster attacks. (Not yet)
8. Find out which quests are key. Those are the ones required to progress.
9. If you're having trouble, try again.
10. If you're still having trouble, do your research. Hopefully this guide will help you understand what you could improve on.


** Basic Concepts of...
* Hunt
As you might have guessed by the title, the goal of most quests in Monster Hunter is to hunt monsters. There are exceptions such as harvesting that this guide will not cover as they should be made fairly clear by the game itself. The only way of successfully completing a hunt quest is to either bring the monster's health to zero by repeatedly hitting it with your sharp stick of choice, or to capture it. You will not know how much health the monster has left, but eventually you'll become capable of guessing it by observing the monster's behaviour. Universally, monsters that have around 10-15% of their health left will start limping, and often will try to escape to their nest, where they'll sleep.
* Crafting
After you defeat the monster you'll be able to carve off parts of their body for use in crafting better weapons and armor, which will then make future hunts easier. Getting parts off of monsters you haven't hunted before will unlock new armor and weapon at the smith. Some parts can only be obtained by breaking a specific part of a monster's body, and the game will generally not tell you which parts those are. Expect to have to do research online.
* Weapons
A decision that you'll have to make early in the game is which weapon type you will use. Make sure to take your time to try out all the weapons, or at least the ones that you have an interest in. If you become invested in the series eventually you will learn how to use a lot more than just one weapon, but your first pick will be what you'll most likely stick to while learning the game's fundamentals, and it's important that it is one that you enjoy using. At the start of every game you'll receive a free starting weapon of every type, available in your equipment box.
* Items
Besides crafting, you'll also want to make sure that you're stocked up on useful items such as potions to help you on your hunt. You can generally find item ingredients in hunting areas, but each game will provide alternative ways of acquiring them.

This section will explain the combat mechanics of Monster Hunter. While you're free to ignore the inner workings of some, there are advantages you can gain by understanding them.

## Monster States
When the hunt starts, the monster is usually in its normal state. This will change as an effect of taking damage, as there are a few special states it can go in.
# Exhaust
Just as the hunter, monsters have stamina value that is hidden. Using their attacks or becoming afflicted with Exhaust status will reduce this value. When the monster reaches a low enough value, it'll go into a special, temporary Exhausted state. Exhaustion has many negative effects on the monster: they'll idle more while drooling, its attacks and movement become ineffective and sluggish, it loses the ability to Enrage, and effects of some items, such as traps, become more powerful on them. An exhausted monster will slowly regenerate stamina, it'll attempt to eat smaller monsters, as well as it'll use a biting attack more often. If it manages to bite a hunter twice, or finishes eating, it will instantly recover enough stamina to go back into its normal state.
There are a few other nuances to the way monster stamina works, as explained [here by GaijinHunter].
# Limp
A monster that took enough damage will eventually hit the limp threshold, which varies by monster and can be around 8%-16%. This will make their walk slower, and they'll start running away to other zones a lot more often. This is the cue for knowing that the monster's health is low, and that it can be captured, although the actual health threshold for capture is often a bit higher than limping, which means that monsters that aren't limping can be captured if their health is low enough. Many limping monsters, after they run away, will try to reach their nest and sleep, if they aren't interrupted.
# Sleep
Induced by low health or Sleep status damage, a sleeping monster will wake up after exactly one hit. This first hit will deal massive x3 damage, and every hit afterwards will be unmodified. This means that in order to make the most of this mechanic, it's important to wake up monsters with powerful, single hits, such as a charged Great Sword smash. A common technique is to set a single Large Bomb up next to the sleeping monsters, and hit it while taking care not to hit the monster, for example with a ranged weapon, a thrown stone, or a carefully positioned much smaller bomb. Wake-up bombs deal damage that is devastating to the monster's health and parts.
# Enrage
Some monsters possess the ability to enrage, which generally happens after taking a certain amount of damage. Enrage can be seen as the opposite of exhaust, and its effects vary quite a lot by monster; An enraged monster becomes far more aggressive and dangerous, with faster, more damaging attacks, sometimes accompanied by a drastic visual change in the monster's appearance, or signaled by a roar. They won't become exhausted until after the enrage ends, and items may have different effects on them. Even an enraged monster's defensive qualities will change, as their hit zones and elemental weaknesses shift. The enrage will end after the monster takes enough damage in some cases, while in others the hunters can wait it out.

## Thresholds
Many effects explained on this page - mounting, status effects, KO(all simply known as 'status') - are all governed by a similar mechanic by which they can be applied.
For every status, a monster has an initial tolerance. As damage of that status is dealt, it builds up until it reaches that initial tolerance value, and that's when its effects are applied. In addition, the previously built-up damage of that type gets reset to zero, and the tolerance increases by a set amount, up to a certain maximum. Over time, built-up status damage will slowly decay.
The initial and maximum tolerance, growth step and decay rate, as well as duration and damage(in the case of Poison and Blast) are all values that vary from monster to monster. Jump, Mount, and Blast statutes do not decay.

## Stagger
Somewhat similarly to status effects, every part on a monster's body has a certain stagger threshold; once that much damage is dealt to it, the monster will stagger(flinch). If a single part takes a staggering hit multiple times, it will break, visually shattering and causing the monster to reel in pain even more than a regular flinch. When a monster's legs are dealt a stagger, the monster will temporarily trip, letting the hunters deal a lot of free damage.
In the same way, many monsters' tails can be cut off by dealing enough damage with Cut damage. With minor exceptions, only Blademaster weapons other than Hammer and Hunting Horn deal Cutting damage. [expand later]

## Broken Parts
Besides causing a longer stagger and marking the appearance of the monster, there are other benefits to breaking parts. Primarily, a broken part may often add unique monster parts to the quest rewards, as well as occasionally drop a 'shiny' - an item that can be picked off of the ground, that also has a chance of being an extra monster part. When a tail is cut, it will physically drop on the ground and the hunters will have to carve off of it in order to receive tail-specific rewards.
In addition to all this, in some cases breaking parts can actually weaken the monster. A common instance is the fact that cutting off a tail will make tail attacks have less range, but often this is more monster specfic. For example, a Gypceros' head break will make his blinding flash attack impotent; breaking the back of a Gravios severely weakens his gas clouds.

## Jump and Mount
All damage dealt to monsters while airborne will count as Jump status damage. Succesfully applying the Jump status will simply cause the monster to trip; however, if your airborne attack hits the head or back of the monster, it will also do Mount damage, which can cause you to mount the monster and engage in the mounting minigame.

## Status Weapons
Some weapons deal a small amount of extra status damage in addition to its raw damage. As explained above, dealing enough status damage can apply its effects, which are as follows:
Poison - Deals damage over time.
Sleep - Causes the monster to immediately fall asleep. The background music will cease, giving the hunters enough time to react and stop attacking in order to not accidentally wake it up with a weak hit.
Paralysis - Forces the monster to stop moving for a short time. 
Blast - [paste gaijins entire video on blast]

## Exhaust and KO
Exhaust and KO damage is somewhat unique; it comes primarily from all Hunting Horn and Hammer attacks, although some other weapons have limited capability of applying it [expand]. When an attack that can deal this damage lands, the Exhaust effect is always added; however, KO is only applied if the attack connects with the head of the monster, which is signified by an extra visual effect for the hit.
The effect of a KO is stunning the monster(represented visually with stars circling above its head) which is similar to paralysis, with the caveat that no further KO damage can be dealt as long as the monster is stunned.
Successfully applying Exhaust removes a significant chunk of the monster's stamina. This is usually enough to reduce it to nothing, causing it to immediately become exhausted.

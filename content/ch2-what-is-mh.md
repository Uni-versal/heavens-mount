# What kind of game is Monster Hunter?
Monster Hunter is a pure action game, but with an emphasis on preparation. You'll spend most of your time hitting various monsters with your weapon of choice, while learning how to avoid getting squashed; afterwards, you'll use monster parts to create better armor, sharper sticks, and consumable items that can help out on the hunt. In addition, you'll need to study details of each monster's unique behaviour and environment in order to turn it into swanky hats more efficiently.  

# I've seen footage of people hunting in groups. Do I need other people to enjoy the game?
One of the great things about Monster Hunter is that it can be enjoyed both as a single-player experience or in a group of up to 4 friends. There are hunters that mostly play in only one of these two ways, and it is entirely up to you what you will do.
All quests in the game can be completed by a lone hunter. Doing so is a great challenge that will require a significant time investment, comparable to the learning curve of fighting games, which is very appealing to many people.  
On the other hand, hunting in groups, while still can be quite challenging, generally offers a more relaxed and casual experience.  
This guide applies fully to both group and solo play, although it is written with the solo hunter in mind, as those who hunt primarily in groups won't have to worry too much about learning some of the advanced mechanics.

While Monster Hunter is challenging, it bears mentioning that it's more accessible than many other action titles. Almost every monster attack has such a long start-up that it is easy to react to everything that happens on the screen. The game also has almost no execution requirements, beyond the ability to manipulate a standard two-stick game controller, which is possible even for [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/4zpjax/any_other_disabled_hunters_out_thereadvice/d6y6cxw/) people with disabilities.

# How much play time can I get out of Monster Hunter?
A better question would be, how much time can Monster Hunter get out of you? These games easily have hundreds of hours of gameplay, and many players will keep playing essentially forever, as there's always more to do.

<summary>Misconceptions about Monster Hunter</summary>
Some people that haven't played this series may hold misguided ideas about what it's like, and I find myself obliged to dispell some of the most common.  
MonHun is not an RPG game, in the sense that it involves no personal stats or leveling up. Your character will never be stuck in a single play style, and while crafting provides a way of becoming stronger, the primary means of progression is simply getting better at playing the game.  
Monster Hunter also does not feature excessive grinding, at least not until the very end-game. Every now and then you will find it useful to hunt a monster multiple times while progressing but it is by no means the main substance of the game. It also does not feature an open world; quests are done in large but restricted areas that you leave after the monster you were hunting dies.  
Last but not least, Monster Hunter is, *not* like the Souls games; there are obvious similarities in controls, both series are known for being challenging, and of course, there are people that love both. However, in gameplay, they are vastly different: Souls games emphasise exploration while maintaining spatial awareness, and their combat rewards patience; Monster Hunter features relentless combat that emphasises positioning and rewards aggressiveness, and exploration is not really a part of the game.

# Which Monster Hunter games should I play?
Even though this guide is driven by Monster Hunter: World coming out in early 2018, the series has a lot more to offer than just the most recent entry. Of the 3DS games, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate has so far been considered the peak of the series in terms of gameplay and presentation, and will always be great to play, as well as the best one to try before World, if you can. Monster Hunter Generations is also a fun game that's easier in solo play than 4 Ultimate, and will have the most active online community until World comes out, but Generations has made some unusual gameplay changes that will for the most part not carry over into future iteration of the series, and may even teach bad habits to new players.  
For those who do not have a 3DS but would still like to give the series a try, it is possible to emulate the english-patched version of Monster Hunter Portable 3rd on PC, and even play it online, but we won't provide any further information on this topic. Portable 3rd is also a great entry in the franchise, though it does not feature some quality of life improvements that were added in 4th generation games.  
Although I do not recommend it for new players, for completeness' sake, it's necessary to mention Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. It is a 2nd generation Monster Hunter, playable on the PSP, and is by some considered an amazing game; however, new player may find it too challenging or even frustrating to play. As it is an older title, it doesn't include many of the modernizations of later games, and has a smaller selection of available weapons.

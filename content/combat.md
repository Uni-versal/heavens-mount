This section will explain the combat mechanics of Monster Hunter. While you're free to ignore the inner workings of some, there are advantages you can gain by understanding them.

## Thresholds
Many effects explained on this page - mounting, status effects, KO(all simply known as 'status') - are all governed by a similar mechanic by which they can be applied.
For every status, a monster has an initial tolerance. As damage of that status is dealt, it builds up until it reaches that initial tolerance value, and that's when its effects are applied. In addition, the previously built-up damage of that type gets reset to zero, and the tolerance increases by a set amount, up to a certain maximum. Over time, built-up status damage will slowly decay.
The initial and maximum tolerance, growth step and decay rate, as well as duration and damage(in the case of Poison and Blast) are all values that vary from monster to monster. Jump, Mount, and Blast statutes do not decay.

### Stagger
Somewhat similarly to status effects, every part on a monster's body has a certain stagger threshold; once that much damage is dealt to it, the monster will stagger(flinch). If a single part takes a staggering hit multiple times, it will break, visually shattering and causing the monster to reel in pain even more than a regular flinch. When a monster's legs are dealt a stagger, the monster will temporarily trip, letting the hunters deal a lot of free damage.
In the same way, many monsters' tails can be cut off by dealing enough damage with Cut damage. With minor exceptions, only Blademaster weapons other than Hammer and Hunting Horn deal Cutting damage. [expand later]

# Basic Concepts of...
### Hunting
As you might have guessed by the title, the goal of most quests in Monster Hunter is to hunt monsters. A hunt can be completed by bringing the monster's health to zero by repeatedly hitting it with your sharp stick of choice, or by capturing it. You will not know exactly how much health the monster has left, but eventually you'll get a good feel for guessing it by observing the monster's behaviour. Universally, monsters that have around 10-15% of their health left will start limping, and they'll try to escape to their nest, where they'll sleep.
### Crafting
After you defeat the monster you'll be able to carve off parts of their body for use in crafting better weapons and armor, which will then make future hunts easier. Getting parts off of monsters you haven't hunted before will unlock new armor and weapon at the smith. Some parts can only be obtained by breaking a specific part of a monster's body, and the game will generally not tell you which parts those are. Expect to have to do research online.

### Weapons
A decision that you'll have to make early in the game is which weapon type you'll use. Make sure to take your time to try out all the weapons, or at least the ones that you think look cool. If you become invested in the series you'll eventually learn how to use a lot more than just one weapon, but your first pick will be what you'll stick to while learning the game's fundamentals, and it's important that it is one that you enjoy using. After making a new character, you'll receive a free starting weapon of every type, available in your equipment box.
[Should gunner vs blademaster be mentioned here? The terms are used in the tips section. Maybe move tips after weapons section?]
### Items
Besides crafting, you'll also want to make sure that you're stocked up on useful items such as potions to help you on your hunt. You can generally find item ingredients in hunting areas, and some you can buy, but each game will also provide alternative ways of acquiring them through building farms or trading.

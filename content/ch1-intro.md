Monster Hunter is a great series that many have chosen to sink hundreds, even thousands of hours into. However, the combination of challenging gameplay, steep learning curve created by the large amount of mechanics present, and often lacking in-game tutorials, have always made it difficult for new players to ease their way into the franchise.  
With the upcoming release of Monster Hunter: World in mind, Heaven's Mount aims to provide a starting point for new and interested players, as well as be a helpful guide for fledgling hunters who are looking to improve their game.

And even though Monster Hunter is a fairly deep game, that doesn't mean you need to read a book before playing; it's best that you first enjoy it for what it is on your own, and come here when you want to learn more about the game, or face difficulties while hunting monsters.

# Which games in the series does this guide apply to?
Eventually, all of them. As of right now, the information we have on Monster Hunter World is limited, but as we get closer to release the guide will be updated to match World. Afterwards, it will still try to mention game differences in cases where they're important.

# What will this guide teach me?
We're looking to explain the strategy, mechanics and advanced concepts of Monster Hunter in a digestible form. Monhun games involve a large amount of hidden mechanics that veteran players take for granted and understand intuitively, but will be impenetrable to a beginner. This guide will not teach you complete basics such as the controls or the interface of the game, but it also won't be a data dump full of foreign concepts that would only be useful to very advanced players.

The guide is structured in chapters covering separate topics to make it easy to find information, but the reading order is not important, except for the next two chapters which are aimed at those who haven't tried the game yet, or are still unsure if they want to buy it.

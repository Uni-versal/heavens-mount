# Status Thresholds
Many special effects explained earlier in chapter 4 - Status, Jump, Mounting, Exhaust and KO - are all governed by the same underlying mechanic that controls how they become applied to the monster.
For every status, a monster has an initial tolerance. As damage of that status is dealt, it builds up until it reaches that initial tolerance value, and once it does, its effects are applied. The previously built-up damage of that type gets reset to zero, and the tolerance increases by a set amount, up to a certain maximum. Over time, built-up status damage will slowly decay.
The initial and maximum tolerance, growth step and decay rate, as well as duration and damage(in the case of Poison and Blast) are all values that vary from monster to monster. Jump, Mount, and Blast statutes do not decay.

# Exhaust and KO
Exhaust and KO damage is somewhat unique; it comes primarily from all Hunting Horn and Hammer attacks, although some other weapons have limited capability of applying it. When an attack that can deal this damage lands, the Exhaust effect is always added; however, KO is only applied if the attack connects with the head of the monster, which is signified by a yellow flash.
The effect of a successful KO is stunning the monster(stars will circle above its head) which is very similar to paralysis, with the caveat that no further KO damage can be dealt as long as the monster is stunned.
With enough Exhaust damage dealt, a significant chunk of the monster's stamina will be removed. This will often be enough to reduce it to nothing, causing it to immediately become exhausted.

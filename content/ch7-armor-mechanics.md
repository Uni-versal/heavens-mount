# Skill Points
Besides improving your defense, the primary motivation for using armor are Armor Skills, which are often badly misunderstood by beginners. Most armor pieces will grant you points in a skill; however, by itself, those points *do not do anything*. In order to receive the benefits of a Skill, you need to activate it by having 10(usually) or more points in that Skill. It is also possible to activate negative versions of some Skills with -10 points.
Some skills activate with merely 5 skill points, and some skills have better versions that can be activated at higher tresholds of 15 and 20 points. You can find this information by checking the skill database of the appropriate game online. You can find out your currently active armor skills and their point levels by checking your character's status pages.
Armor Skills can have a huge impact on your strength. While the best builds vary wildly between games and weapons, and covering every situation is far beyond the scope of this guide, in most cases a good starting point is to aim to get skills that directly help your damage, such as Attack Up. As you advance further in the game, ask other players, or do your research to find out what skills you should be using.

# Talismans and Decorations
Talismans and Decorations are special parts of your equipment that don't improve your defenses, but contribute to your Armor Skill Points. They're a very important part of activating Armor Skills, as just combining the right armor pieces is often not enough.

# Upgrading
Directly upgrading your armor usually comes at the cost of money and Armor Spheres(or other materials), and raises its Defense value.
This is basically always worth doing, unless you're still using your starting armor or have difficulty finding more upgrade materials; more defense means less damage taken means easier hunts. 

# Resistances
Resists are rarely an important consideration when crafting new armor, but it is worth understanding how they function. Armor pieces add resistance modifiers, which reduce or increase the elemental damage you receive of the appropriate type. The resistance is applied directly, as a percentage: if your Water resistance is -10, then you will receive 10% more damage from water attacks. Fire is a common damage type that monsters deal, so resisting it is fairly valuable.

# Troubleshooting Walls
There's a good chance that at some point you'll find yourself facing a wall; a monster that you just can't beat even after multiple attempts. It's at this point that you'll have to rethink the way you play. Consider this guide a checklist; go through the chapters 4-8 one more time to make sure you've done everything you can to give yourself an advantage.  
However, sometimes, when you believe you've learned all there is to know, re-examined all your item and equipment choices, you'll still be having trouble. This is where your mentality comes into play. 

# Challenge and Improvement
Beyond everything there is to learn about Monster Hunter, the fundamental thing you'll need is the right mentality. Sometimes the game is just hard. Especially as you hunt solo, in order to be able to succeed, you'll need to steel yourself with the will to keep trying, and apply your ability to actively learn. Make note of your mistakes, and look for more windows of opportunity to land attacks. Your mentality will be tested, and you'll feel rewarded if you can pull through.


# Observing Monsters
A large part of getting better at the game is observing the monsters. By learning to recognize the animations, sounds and common patterns of their behaviour, you'll be able to navigate around attacks better. Knowing when to walk out of the way, roll, or even not move at all will let you find more opportunities to keep hitting.
A basic example is the fact that some monsters will often tail spin twice in a row. Many beginners often assume that it is safe to get close after the first tail spin, and get caught by the second one; you can also use this to your own advantage by standing in a deadzone of the second tail spin, such as between the legs of the monster.
Your own positioning will also influence what the monster will do. A monster that sees many players at a large distance away from them will charge or fly more often than normal, which can also be abused to bait the monster into a trap.

## Positioning
Even more important than knowing when to attack, is knowing where to attack from.
Proper positioning is crucial in Monster Hunter; it is literally what makes the difference between a mediocre hunter and a good hunter. However, it effectively cannot be taught, as the optimal positioning will be different for every monster, weapon, environment, situation, and even player, and learning it comes only with experience.
Good positioning is informed by knowing the moveset and patterns of a monster, and aims to minimize risk while maximizing your own opportunities to attack. As a basic example, if you know that a monster has a dangerous charging attack that can start very quickly, it will be dangerous to stand right in front of that monster. Keep in mind that this decision making is fluid; the risk of getting hit can be counterbalanced by the expected reward for repeatedly hitting a specific part - but not necessarily when your health is low, or you don't feel confident in your ability to dodge.
A basic tip that applies to many fights, for Blademasters, is to stick close to the legs of a monster. Hitting the legs will often lead to the great reward of tripping them, and can entirely avoid many tail sweep, bite and charging attacks. You will still have to watch out for attacks that you might be vulnerable to such as hip checks, wing smashes and tail spins. Everyone is human, and no one can avoid all attacks forever; you have plenty of room for mistakes in MonHun, and with astute observation of the situation you'll be able to avoid a lot of unnecessary hits, and therefore attack a lot more often yourself.


# Aggressiveness
While not getting hit is vital, something that can be less obvious to new players, but becomes of utmost importance in higher ranks, is the necessity to deal a lot of hits often. As a consequence of the mechanics of staggers, exhaust, limping, and enrage, dealing a lot of damage provides a way of not just bringing the monster's health down, but also keeping its movement and aggression in check. In fact, since it is very hard to consistently avoid all attacks, at higher ranks the beginner tactic of dealing a few hits then running away will simply stop working, as it will end up with the hunter running away to heal much too often, while dealing barely any hits, and eventually running out the timer or dying. This is why the 'Hit it until it dies' internet meme is legitimately good advice; you need to hit it as much as it can, and that will help you succeed in more ways than you may expect.

## Beating the Timer
Quests in Monster Hunter are timed. While generally it is not a problem to complete most quests within the limit even if you play carefully, and when you're just starting out you should ignore the timer as you focus on learning the fundamentals and the monsters, looking at your quest times is a good way to gauge how much you can still improve.

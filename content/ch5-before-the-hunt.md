Beyond crafting better equipment, there are many things you can do that will positively influence your hunts.

** Hit Zones
The concept of hit zones means that every monster takes varying amounts of damage from hits depending on where you hit it, and properly applying this concept can almost double the damage that you're dealing. In World learning them will become quite a bit easier, as there'll now be damage numbers, which means you'll be able to simply hit the monster in every point on its body with the same attack and pay attention to which take more damage.
Beyond that, if you want to know for sure, wish to learn the exact numbers, or are playing an older game of the series that doesn't feature damage numbers, you'll need to do research online. For the 3DS games a great resource is kiranico.com.
Hit zones vary by weapon type, which means that Ranged weapons, Blunt weapons, and Cutting weapons all get different values. The values themselves are often fairly arbitrary; there are some rules of thumbs such as the head often takes more damage, while parts that look like they're more heavily armored or ones that often cause weapons bouncing tend to take less. These don't always hold true and you'll still need to do your research.
Keep in mind that while a monster is in a special state such as an enrage, their hit zones can change, sometimes drastically. Gigginox's head in its normal state takes twice as much damage than its tail, but when it's enraged, these two hitzones swap, and now its tail takes more damage. As another example, Zamtrios' belly takes massive damage when it's inflated.

** Elemental Weaknesses
Many weapons deal a small amount of extra damage as elemental damage. Those are situational and the weapons chapter explains when you should use such weapons, but the primary motivation for them lies in the elemental weaknesses of monsters; every monster has one or two elemental types that they can take more damage from. However, just knowing that a monster is weak to a certain type is often not enough. As an extension of the hit zone mechanic, every hit zone also affects the elemental damage, and those values can be just as arbitrary. As usual, do your research or testing in order to find out what's the most effective thing to do.

** Food
Every Monhun game has some form a food mechanic(replaced by bathing in hot springs in Portable 3rd). Eating before a hunt is essentially a buff that will increase your maximum health, stamina, and sometimes give other benefits. As eating is essentially free, you should always do it before every single hunt.
The games also feature quests that improve the benefits of eating, which start out quite insignificant. Doing these those quests as soon as they become available is just as important as eating.
The extra food effects vary by game(so do your research), and can be quite useful, such as gaining more resistance in the type that the monster you'll be fighting deals a lot of, or simply dealing more damage.

** Cats
[cats are bad don't do cats]

** Items
The various plants, shrooms and other miscellanea you collect on your hunts serve as ingredients in combining consumable items. Some beginners make the mistake of ignoring those items beyond the basic potion, but they can be very important in dealing with some hunts. More powerful healing, methods of stunning the monster, dealing more damage, are all available through items. While the specifics of what items will be available in World, or their effects and ingredients aren't known yet, here is a list of ones that have consistently been present and useful in past installments of the series.
[add more, explain each item]
* Mega Potion
* Max Potion
* Lifepowder
* Paintball - likely delet
* Barrel Bomb
* Flash Bomb - likely delet
* Dung Bomb
* Barrel Bombs

** Farm
Monhun games generally provide some replenishable way of acquiring item ingredients without having to spend too much time harvesting them. In Portable 3rd and Freedom Unite there are farms you can get items out of, while 4 Ultimate and Generation let you duplicate items that you already have. The exact mechanics that will be present in World are as of yet unknown but they're very likely to be worth using, just as they are in the other games.

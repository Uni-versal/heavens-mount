Beyond crafting better equipment, there are other things you can do that will positively influence your hunts.

# Hit Zones
A crucial part of being competent at Monster Hunter is the understanding of hit zones. Every time you hit a monster, the damage you deal depends heavily on which part of the monster your attack connected with.   
The effectiveness of hitting a certain zone is different for each weapon type, which means that Shot(Gunners), Blunt(Hammer and Hunting Horn) and Cutting (everything else) all get a completely different set of values for every monster. The values themselves are often fairly arbitrary, though there are some rules of thumb, with the head usually taking more damage and parts that look like they're heavily armored or ones that cause weapons bouncing tend to take less.  
On top of this, while a monster is in a special state such as an enrage, their hit zones can change, sometimes drastically. For example, Gigginox's head in its normal state takes twice as much damage than its tail, but these two hitzones swap when enraged, and the tail takes more damage. A Zamtrios can change state by inflating its belly, but this inflated belly also becomes a massive weak spot.
[were probably going to add pictures for each but i'm mentioning it anyway]
The addition of damage numbers in World will make learning hit zones easier, allowing you to simply hit the monster in various places and see which take more damage.  
Beyond that, if you want to know in advance, or are playing an older game of the series that doesn't feature damage numbers, you'll need to do research online. For the 3DS games a great resource is [kiranico.com](kiranico.com).


# Elemental Weaknesses
Many weapons deal a small amount of extra damage as elemental damage. Each elemental damage type is situational, and the weapons chapter explains when you should use such weapons, but the primary motivation for them lies in the elemental weaknesses of monsters. Every monster has one or two elemental types that they can take more damage from. However, just knowing that a monster is weak to a certain type isn't enough, because elemental damage is governed by hit zones as well, and those values can be just as arbitrary. As usual, you'll have to do your research to find out what's the most effective.

# Items
The various plants, shrooms and other miscellanea you collect on your hunts serve as ingredients in combining consumable items. Some beginners make the mistake of ignoring items beyond the basic potion, but they can be very important in some hunts. More powerful healing, ways of stunning the monster, dealing more damage, and others, are all available through items. While the specifics of the items in World aren't known yet, here is a list of ones that have consistently been present and useful in past installments of the series.  
[add more, explain each item]
[I might put this at the top, your items are your batman utility belt]


* Mega Potion
* Max Potion
* Lifepowder
* Paintball - likely gone
* Flash Bomb - likely gone
* Dung Bomb
* Barrel Bombs
* Traps

# Food
Most Monster Hunter games have some form a food mechanic that lets you prepare before beginning the hunt. Eating before a hunt gives buffs which can increase your maximum health, stamina, and sometimes give other benefits. As eating is essentially free, you should do it before every single hunt.  
The bonuses you'll get from food start out quite insignificant, but there are quests that unlock better food with stronger benefits. Doing these those quests as soon as they become available is just as important as eating.  
The extra food effects vary by game (so do your research), and can help you specifically prepare for certain hunts, giving resistance in the damage type the monster deals a lot of, or simply dealing more damage yourself.

# Farms
Monhun games generally provide some replenishable way of acquiring item ingredients without having to spend too much time harvesting them. In Portable 3rd and Freedom Unite, there are farms you can get items out of, while 4 Ultimate and Generations let you duplicate items that you already have. The exact mechanics that will be present in World are as of yet unknown, but they're very likely to be worth using, just as they are in the other games.

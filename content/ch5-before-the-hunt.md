Beyond crafting better equipment, there are other things you can do that will positively influence your hunts.

# Hit Zones
A crucial part of being competent at Monster Hunter is the understanding of hit zones. Every time you hit a monster, the damage you deal depends heavily on which part of the monster your attack connected with.  
Hit zones vary by weapon type, which means that Shot(Gunners), Blunt(Hammer and Hunting Horn) and Cutting(everything else) all get a completely different set of values for every monster. The values themselves are often fairly arbitrary, though there are some rules of thumb such as the head usually takes more damage, while parts that look like they're more heavily armored or ones that often cause weapons bouncing tend to take less.
On top of this, while a monster is in a special state such as an enrage, their hit zones can change, sometimes drastically. For example, Gigginox's head in its normal state takes twice as much damage than its tail, but when it's enraged, these two hitzones swap, and now its tail takes more damage; Zamtrios' belly takes massive damage when it's inflated.
In World learning hit zones will become quite easy, as there will now be damage numbers, which means you'll be able to simply hit the monster in various parts and pay attention to which take more damage.
Beyond that, if you want to know in advance, or are playing an older game of the series that doesn't feature damage numbers, you'll need to do research online. For the 3DS games a great resource is kiranico.com.


# Elemental Weaknesses
Many weapons deal a small amount of extra damage as elemental damage. Those are situational and the weapons chapter explains when you should use such weapons, but the primary motivation for them lies in the elemental weaknesses of monsters; every monster may have one or two elemental types that they can take more damage from. However, just knowing that a monster is weak to a certain type isn't enough, because elemental damage is governed by hit zones as well; those values can be just as arbitrary. As usual, you'll have to do your research to find out what's the most effective thing to do.

# Items
The various plants, shrooms and other miscellanea you collect on your hunts serve as ingredients in combining consumable items. Some beginners make the mistake of ignoring those items beyond the basic potion, but they can be very important in dealing with some hunts. More powerful healing, ways of stunning the monster, dealing more damage, and others, are all available through items. While the specifics of what items will be available in World, or their effects and ingredients aren't known yet, here is a list of ones that have consistently been present and useful in past installments of the series.
[add more, explain each item]
* Mega Potion
* Max Potion
* Lifepowder
* Paintball - likely gone
* Flash Bomb - likely gone
* Dung Bomb
* Barrel Bombs
* Traps

# Food
Every Monhun game has some form a food mechanic(replaced by bathing in hot springs in Portable 3rd). Eating before a hunt is essentially a buff that will increase your maximum health, stamina, and sometimes give other benefits. As eating is essentially free, you should do it before every single hunt.
The bonuses you'll get from food start out quite insignificant but there are quests that unlock better food with stronger benefits. Doing these those quests as soon as they become available is just as important as eating.
The extra food effects vary by game(so do your research), and can be quite useful, such as gaining more resistance in the type that the monster you'll be fighting deals a lot of, or simply dealing more damage yourself.

# Cats

# Farms
Monhun games generally provide some replenishable way of acquiring item ingredients without having to spend too much time harvesting them. In Portable 3rd and Freedom Unite there are farms you can get items out of, while 4 Ultimate and Generation let you duplicate items that you already have. The exact mechanics that will be present in World are as of yet unknown but they're very likely to be worth using, just as they are in the other games.

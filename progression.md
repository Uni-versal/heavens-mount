## Stars and Key Quests
Quests in Monster Hunter are ranked with Stars, which map out the progression through the game. Unlocking the next Star requires you to complete every Key Quest in your highest Star, and finishing the Urgent Quest which will then appear. You can find out which Quests are Key online, although talking to NPCs will sometimes make it obvious[Keys might be marked in World].
Monsters fought in higher Stars have slightly higher health values and tend to be more dangerous.


## Low Rank, High Rank, G Rank
Beyond Stars, quests are ranked in another, more substantial way. Monster Hunter games start out in the Low Rank, progress into High Rank, and finish in G-Rank(some MH games don't have G Rank and end after High Rank). Every Rank comprises of multiple Star levels.
Advancing into High and G Rank has a profound effect. The average monster health increases drastically, monsters that you've fought previously become far more aggressive, and deal significantly more damage. In addition, in High and G-Rank, rare monster subspecies as well as powerful monsters known as Elder Dragons start appearing more often as Quest targets.


## Hunter Rank
Also known as HR(not to be confused with High Rank) is a rank of honour that roughly represents the experience of a given hunter. At the start of the game, your HR will be equivalent to your highest Star level, but will become unlocked once you complete all High Rank Key Quests. HR is raised by simply completing hunts, with harder quests increasing it faster. Besides cosmetic, higher HR also unlocks some end-game quests.


## Advanced Quests
Some special quests will count as Advanced quests, and have 'Advanced' in its name. Those aren't always available, which is random; you can reroll your set of Advanced quests by completing any other quest that isn't a Harvest Tour. [possibly removed in World]
